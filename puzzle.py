""" Simple Instructions:

Create your puzzle as a subclass of Puzzle().
The first step is to choose a representation of the problem
state preferably stored as a string.  Set 'pos' to the starting
position and 'goal' to the ending position.  Create a genmoves()
method that computes all possible new puzzle states reachable from
the current state.  Call the .solve() method to solve the puzzle.

Important Note:

The __iter__() method must return a list of puzzle instances, not
their representations.  It should be written as a generator, returning
its results through yield.

Advanced Instructions:

1. .solve(pop_pos=DEPTH_FIRST) will override the default breadth first search.
Use depth first when the puzzle known to be solved in a fixed number
of moves (for example, the eight queens problem is solved only when
the eighth queen is placed on the board; also, the triangle tee problem
removes one tee on each move until all tees are removed).  Breadth first
is ideal when the shortest path solution needs to be found or when
some paths have a potential to wander around infinitely (i.e. you can
randomly twist a Rubik's cube all day and never come near a solution).

2. Define __str__ for a pretty printed version of the current position.
The state for the Tee puzzle looks best when the full triangle is drawn.

3. If the goal state can't be defined as a string, override the isgoal()
method.  For instance, the block puzzle is solved whenever block 1 is
in the lower left, it doesn't matter where the other pieces are; hence,
isgoal() is defined to check the lower left corner and return a boolean.

4. Some puzzle's can be simplified by treating symmetric positions as
equal.  Override the .canonical() method to pick one of the equilavent
positions as a representative.  This allows the solver to recognize paths
similar ones aleady explored.  In tic-tac-toe an upper left corner on
the first move is symmetrically equivalent to a move on the upper right;
hence there are only three possible first moves (a corner, a midde side,
or in the center).
